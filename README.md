recognition phoneme 'a', using model_a, lengths set = all lengths set for phoneme 'n',
t.k. 80% lengths set for phoneme 'a' > all lengths set for phoneme 'n'.

recognition accuracy for phoneme 'a': t.k. I us 80% * lengths set for phoneme 'a' = all lengths set for phoneme 'n' =>
lengths test set N_a = 20% * len(corpus['n'])/80%
